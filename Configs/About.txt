About Configs
-------------
Values below 2 ms or above 50 ms are considered errors and discarded.

Photoresistor light values are calibrated to the lowest level possible without introducing errors.
These settings may need to be relaxed when measuring muzzle flash instead of the reflex flash box.


Arduino_Click
-------------
---Board must be plugged into PC---
1. Arduino device acts as a mouse
2. Triggers left mouse click in intervals
3. Measures latency on light flash
---Measurments do not include mouse latency---


Arduino_Paint
-------------
---Board must be plugged into PC---
1. Arduino device acts as a mouse
2. Triggers right mouse click and left mouse click in intervals
3. Measures latency on light flash
---Measurments do not include mouse latency---


Arduino_UE4
-----------
---Board must be plugged into PC---
1. Arduino device acts as a mouse and keyboard
2. Triggers left mouse click and "b" key in intervals
3. Measures latency on light flash
---Measurments do not include mouse latency---


Mouse_Auto_Click
----------------
---Board can be powered seperately (Useful for anticheat)---
1. Arduino device toggles external mouse to click
2. Triggers left mouse click in intervals
3. Measures latency on light flash
---Measurments include mouse latency---


Mouse_Manual_Click
------------------
---Board can be powered seperately (Useful for anticheat)---
1. User manually clicks left mouse click in intervals
2. Measures latency on light flash
---Measurments include mouse latency---
